        As we enter the third decade of the 21st century, where do women stand in technology and IT? Kaspersky decided to build on the research it began in 2018, and in 2020 the company <a href="https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/85/2021/01/18101159/Kaspersky-Women-in-Tech-2021-Report-V2-Final.pdf">spoke to women</a> in Europe, North America, Latin America and the APAC region to find out how they now feel and what has changed over the past two years. There&#789;s plenty of good news: <strong> 57% of the women surveyed agree that gender equality has improved in their organization.</strong> Even COVID-19 has brought benefits, with working from home helping women feel more autonomous in their roles — boosting their confidence as well as their career prospects. But there&#789;s still a lot to be done in the field to truly empower women.
